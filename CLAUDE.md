# pascal-db-faa — Guide for AI agents

A **dual-compiler** (Delphi + Lazarus/FPC) database access layer: driver-agnostic contracts
(`IDBFactory`/`IQuery`/`IParams`), connection pool, migrations, tagged SQL templates,
optional/nullable types and a complete mock for tests. Connection drivers live outside the
core, in adapters.

For the general dual-compiler rules (project anatomy, `.inc`, mirrored tests, CI), use the
`dual-compiler-delphi-lazarus` skill. This file records only what is specific to this repo.

## Language

Everything in this repository is in **English**: code, identifiers, comments, runtime
messages (exceptions, logs), test names and assertion messages, documentation and commit
messages. Test *data* may contain non-ASCII values on purpose (e.g. `'São Paulo'`, to
exercise non-ASCII strings).

## Origin: extracted from delphi-api-infra-faa

The core came out of `delphi-api-infra-faa` (`src/Db/*` + its dependencies in `src/Common`),
at commit **`aa49f2b` (2026-08-25)**. The two repositories are **independent**: fixes made
there after that commit (especially in the pool, the most active area) **do not flow here
automatically**. If delphi-api-infra-faa starts consuming this library (an open decision),
that divergence goes away; until then, check `git log aa49f2b..HEAD -- src/Db
src/Common/Common.Optionals.pas` on that side before assuming both are in sync.

| Here | There |
|---|---|
| `PascalDb.Interfaces` | `Db.Interfaces` |
| `PascalDb.Pool` | `Db.Connection.Pool` |
| `PascalDb.Migrations` | `Db.Migrations` |
| `PascalDb.SqlLoader` / `SqlDialect` / `Registry` / `Mock` | `Db.SqlLoader` / `Db.SqlDialect` / `Db.Adapters.Registry` / `Db.Mock` |
| `PascalDb.Optionals` / `ClockCache` / `SystemContext` / `SafeLog` | `Common.*` with the same name |
| `PascalDb.Threading` | — (new: portable atomics + tick) |

The origin is in Portuguese (comments, messages, some test names); this repository was
translated to English after the extraction, so identifiers and messages differ where they
were Portuguese there.

The `PascalDb.*` prefix is mandatory: `Db.*` would collide with FPC's `db` unit (the base of
SQLdb) and with delphi-api-infra-faa's own units if both libraries were on the same search
path.

---

## Code rules (apply to every unit in `src/`)

- **Every unit includes `{$I pascaldb.inc}` right after `unit ...;`.** The `.inc` turns on
  `{$MODE DELPHI}{$H+}` on FPC and normalizes `PASCALDB_WINDOWS`.
- **`uses` without namespaces** (`SysUtils`, `Generics.Collections`), never
  `System.SysUtils`. Delphi resolves them through the project's `DCC_Namespace`; FPC 3.2.2
  doesn't have the dotted units. A Delphi-only unit goes inside `{$IFNDEF FPC}` with its full
  name (`Winapi.Windows`).
- **No anonymous methods** (`TThread.CreateAnonymousThread`, closures in
  `TEqualityComparer.Construct`, etc.): stable FPC 3.2.2 doesn't have them. Use a `TThread`
  subclass or a named function/method.
- **Public callbacks follow `PASCALDB_FUNCREFS`** (see `pascaldb.inc`): the type is
  `reference to` in Delphi and `of object` in FPC. The portable subset is "pass a method": it
  compiles on both. Delphi-only users can still pass a closure. Real examples:
  `TPoolEventProc`, `TMigrationEventProc`.
- **Atomics and monotonic time only through `PascalDb.Threading`** (`PdbAtomicInc`,
  `PdbAtomicInc64`, `PdbAtomicRead64`, `PdbTickMs`). `TInterlocked` and `TStopwatch` don't
  exist in FPC.
- **Never `TDictionary.Create(AComparer)` with a possibly-`nil` `AComparer`** (see gotcha 1
  below).
- **Top-of-file comment in every unit, program and test**, between `unit X;` (+ `{$I
  pascaldb.inc}`) and `interface`/`uses`:

  ```pascal
  { One sentence: what the unit is.

    Paragraphs: why it exists, decisions, relevant Delphi × FPC gotchas. }
  ```

  Plain prose, no banners (`****`, `----`) and no upper-case headings. If the text needs to
  quote something containing `}` (the SQL tag syntax, a `{$DIRECTIVE}`), use `(* ... *)`: a
  `}` inside `{ }` closes the comment early. In tests, the header says what the unit covers
  and ends with the master/mirror note; the FPCUnit mirror gets the "generated file" note on
  top, added by the generator.

---

## Tests

- The masters are the **DUnitX** files in `tests/Unit/*Tests.pas`, written in **FPCUnit's
  assertion dialect** (`TAssert.AssertEquals/AssertTrue/AssertFalse/Fail`). On Delphi that is
  provided by `tests/Unit/PascalDb.DUnitXCompat.pas`.
- **`tests/Unit/fpc/*Tests.pas` are generated**: `python tools/gen_fpc_mirror.py`. Never edit
  those files by hand. The generator swaps only the fixture declarations and the
  registration; the body comes out byte-for-byte identical. `--check` fails if any mirror is
  out of date.
- **Run on FPC:** `sh tools/test_fpc.sh` (regenerates the mirrors, builds with `lazbuild` and
  runs). **On Delphi:** open `PascalDb.groupproj` in the IDE and run
  `tests/Unit/PascalDb.UnitTests.dproj`. Delphi Community Edition doesn't compile from the
  command line: `dcc32` prints "This version of the product does not support command line
  compiling." and **exits with code 0**. Don't read that as success.
- **Acceptance criterion:** every test green **and 0 leaks on both sides** (heaptrc on FPC,
  `ReportMemoryLeaksOnShutdown` on Delphi).
- Floating point **always with an explicit delta** (`AssertEquals(E, A, 0)` for exact). See
  gotcha 5.
- `python ../skills/dual-compiler-delphi-lazarus/scripts/verify_test_mirrors.py --root .
  --ignore-glob /lib/` is a second check, independent of the generator.

## Adapters (planned)

The core knows no driver. The reference adapters, each in its own package:

| Adapter | Compiler | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FireDAC | Delphi only | to be ported from the original `Db.Adapters.FireDAC` |
| Zeos | dual | to be written (Zeos not installed in the dev environment yet) |
| SQLdb | Lazarus only | to be written |

A third-party adapter implements `IDBComponentProvider`/`IDBFactory` and registers itself in
`TDBRegistry`: the core never has to change to accept a new driver.

---

## Known open items

- **`TSQLLoader` is tied to resources** (`FindResource`/`RT_RCDATA`, `.rc` compiled with
  `brcc32`). It compiles and works on both compilers, but the `.rc` build pipeline differs on
  FPC (`fpcres`/`windres`). Evaluate a pluggable SQL source (resource or a directory of
  `.sql` files) before the adapters, which are the first to need real SQL.
- FPC warns "Function result does not seem to be set" on `TMockDBFactory.CreateSqlScript`.
  False positive: the method always raises (`ISqlScript` isn't supported by the mock).

## Gotchas found (Delphi × FPC 3.2.2)

Format: symptom → cause → fix. Also recorded in the skill: 1–4 in
`references/rtl-gotchas.md` (sections "Generics / RTL collections", "Types" and "Resource
files"); 5–6 in the compat adapter bullet of `SKILL.md` ("Mirrored tests"). Once this repo is
published, replace the "`pascal-db-faa` (not yet public)" mentions there with links.

1. **`TDictionary.Create(nil)` raises an Access Violation on FPC.** Symptom: AV in
   `FindBucketIndex` (`generics.dictionaries.inc`) on the first `Add`/`TryGetValue`: 30 of 158
   tests failed because of it, all through `TClockCache`. Cause: Delphi replaces a `nil`
   comparer with `TEqualityComparer<T>.Default`; FPC's `rtl-generics` stores the `nil` and
   calls `GetHashCode` on it. Fix: `if Assigned(AComparer) then TMap.Create(AComparer) else
   TMap.Create` (`PascalDb.ClockCache`).
2. **`IEqualityComparer<T>` has a different signature**: FPC uses `constref` and a `UInt32`
   hash; Delphi uses `const` and an `Integer` hash. `TEqualityComparer<T>.Construct` accepts a
   closure in Delphi and only a plain function / `of object` in FPC. Fix: a named function
   with the signature under `{$IFDEF FPC}`, which both accept (`SingleKeyEquals`/
   `SingleKeyHash` in `PascalDb.Optionals`).
3. **`TGuid.Empty` doesn't exist in FPC 3.2.2** (it comes from Delphi's `TGuidHelper`). Fix: a
   typed constant `EMPTY_GUID: TGUID = '{00000000-...}'`.
4. **In FPC 3.2.2, `RT_RCDATA` is only in the `system` unit on non-Windows targets**; on
   Windows it lives in the `Windows` unit. Fix: a local constant
   `{$IFDEF FPC}PChar(10){$ELSE}RT_RCDATA{$ENDIF}` (`MAKEINTRESOURCE(10)` on any platform).
5. **FPCUnit has no delta-less `AssertEquals(Double, Double)`**, and FPC resolves the call to
   the `Currency` overload **without any warning**. Symptom: a test comparing `TDateTime`
   passed on FPC at 4-decimal precision, while the original DUnitX test compared `Double`.
   Fix: always an explicit delta; `PascalDb.DUnitXCompat` doesn't offer the delta-less
   overload either, so the master can't compile differently on each side.
6. **DUnitX's `Assert.AreEqual(string, string)` ignores case by default.** The overload
   without `ignoreCase` uses `fIgnoreCaseDefault`, initialized to `true`
   (`source\DUnitX\DUnitX.Assert.pas`, line 1355, in Delphi 12; configurable through
   `Assert.IgnoreCaseDefault`). Already documented in `Redis.DUnitXCompat`; confirmed in the
   source here. The compat adapter passes `False` explicitly.
